Functional Programming Principles in Elixir
===============

This is set of exercises for [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) from the original [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/learn/scala-functional-programming) course, by Martin Odersky. Originally published in 2011, this MOOC had far-reaching influence on many a Java developer by introducing them
to functional programming and probably had an effect on the course of Java language itself. Even if you have
no interest in Scala, it remains one of the best sources for learning functional programming techniques, which are applicable across all functional languages as these exercises shall demonstrate.

There are two types of programmers that should find them especially usefull:
  * newcomers to Elixir wanting to improve their skills at tacking problems in a functional programming style
  * Java/Scala developers curious about functional programming outside of the JVM

Completing these exercises should not only improve your reasoning about functional programming, but hopefully also reveal Elixir as expressive, scalable and sufficiently typesafe language in its own right.

## Getting started

The folders are named exactly as the original homework problems in Scala with each folder being a separete `mix` project. To get started, clone this repo and try out sample problems in `/examples` folder. To verify your solution, run `mix test` and compare with proposed solution under `solutions` branch. If you found a way to improve the proposed solution, please submit a pull request.
